## üöÄ Tech Stack

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Backend*: Node.js + Express + Socket.io  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Frontend*: React + Vite + Socket.io-client  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Database*: MongoDB (for user/session/chat‚Äêhistory storage)  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Communication*: WebSockets (real-time, bi‚Äëdirectional)

## üèó Architecture & Concurrency

1.‚Å† ‚Å†*Server*  
   - Built with Express, wrapped with an HTTP server and integrated with Socket.io.  
   - Listens for ‚Å†‚ÄØconnection‚ÄØ‚Å† events.  
   - Manages user join/leave, broadcasting, and room handling.
   - Stores chat messages (and optionally user metadata) in MongoDB via Mongoose.
   - Each socket connection is handled independently, supporting concurrent real-time messaging.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†*Client*  
   - Built using React and Vite.  
   - Connects via Socket.io client to the server.  
   - Supports joining chat rooms, sending/receiving messages, and live UI updates.

3.‚Å† ‚Å†*Concurrency Handling*  
   - Real-time concurrency is managed natively by Socket.io event queues.  
   - Server emits updates to all clients in relevant rooms.  
   - Multiple users can chat simultaneously without race conditions due to event-driven, single-threaded Node.js runtime.
